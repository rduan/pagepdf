## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Storage Permission Error
**Symptom**: Nothing happens when clicking the button

**Solution**:
- Make sure manifest.json includes `"storage"` permission âœ… (Fixed!)
- Reload the extension after the update

### Issue 2: Can't Access the Page
**Symptom**: Error about not being able to access the page

**Solution**:
- The extension doesn't work on browser internal pages (chrome://, edge://)
- Try on a regular webpage instead
- Use the included `test-page.html` file

### Issue 3: Can't Find Main Content
**Symptom**: "Could not identify main content" error

**Solution**:
- The page might have unusual structure
- Try on a different page to verify extension works
- Check test-page.html first

### Issue 4: Print Dialog Doesn't Appear
**Symptom**: New tab opens but print dialog doesn't show

**Solution**:
- Browser might block auto-print
- Manually press `Cmd + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + P` (Windows)
- Check browser settings for print permissions
